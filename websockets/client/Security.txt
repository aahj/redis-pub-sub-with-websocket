JWT based authentication system

JWT is a powerful tool to manage security on API but it works for Websocket based system too. Itâ€™s as simple as :

Client-side: add a token in your headers
Server-side: before each connection, check the token inside headers.

Client-side:

const WebSocket = require('ws')
const ws = new WebSocket 'ws://localhost:8000', {
    headers : {
        token: "myTokenHere"
    }
}
