If your connections have a long life, which is probably the case if you use Websocket, then you should refresh them (basically close them and open a new one). 
This is useful when you do some stuff when the connection is established and if you want the client to be up to date with the server. 
Or if you want to use another token if it expires soon.

There is no advice here on how to do it because it highly depends on your business logic. 
Anyway, a good recommendation is to refresh the connection every hour then you can change this interval if necessary.
